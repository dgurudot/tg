## Agree that you must keep your trading app OPEN and do NOT put in background or stop or kill app

You're are always supposed to keep your trading app OPEN and in FOREGROUND for auto trades to execute
- Auto Trade requires your TradeGrub trading application to be always open, in foreground and active for auto trade execution.
- If you have connectivity issues then keep it running on a remote PC or cloud server and remote desktop to it to ensure application is always open and have reliable network connectivity.
