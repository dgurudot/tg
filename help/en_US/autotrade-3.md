## Agree that you must use single device during auto trade

You're are always supposed to use single device during auto trade execution
- Data source automatically switches to latest logged-in device and could impact auto trade execution if using multiple devices together for same account.
- Single device is required to ensure real time data source remains connected at all time for auto trade execution.
- Enabling AutoTrade on multiple devices will execute same trade from each individual device. Please be aware and only use single device for AutoTrade. Enable AutoTrade is individual device specific setting.
