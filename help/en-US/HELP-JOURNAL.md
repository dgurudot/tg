# 🧭 Journal Help

The **Journal** screen allows you to view, search, and manage system logs and messages efficiently.

---

## 🔍 Search
Use the **Search** bar at the top of the Journal screen to quickly find specific logs or keywords.  
You can search by:
- Message text
- Module or tag name
- Error type (e.g., “error”, “info”)

This is especially useful for locating a specific issue or debugging event quickly.

---

## 💾 Download
Tap the **Download** icon (📥) on the top-right corner to export all current journal entries into a `.csv` file.  
This file includes:
- Timestamp
- Log type (Info / Error / Warning)
- Message content
- Source (App / Other)

Use this export for offline review or sharing with support teams.

---

## 🗑️ Delete All
Use the **Trash** icon (🗑️) to delete all journal entries.  
A confirmation dialog will appear to prevent accidental deletion.  
Once deleted, these logs **cannot be recovered**, so use this carefully.

## ⚙️ Filters
The **Filter** button (⚗️) allows you to refine which messages are displayed.  
You can filter by multiple options:

### 📅 Date Range
- Select a specific start and end date.
- Only messages within this time window will be displayed.

### ⚠️ Message Type
Choose which types of messages to show:
- **Info** – General updates, actions, or process logs.
- **Error** – Issues, failed actions, or warnings.

### 📱 Source
- **Show App Messages** – Logs generated by the application itself.
- **Show Other Messages** – Includes system-level or external service messages.

These filters can be combined for more granular control — for example, viewing only **error messages from the last 7 days** in **App logs**.

## 💡 Tips
- Long-press on any message to copy or share it.
- Use filters regularly to keep your journal organized.
- Download before clearing if you may need records later.
