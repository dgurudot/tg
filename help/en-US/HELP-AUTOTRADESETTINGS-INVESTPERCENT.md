# **Quantity Percent Per Trade**

## Purpose: 

- This setting defines the percentage of quantity to be purchased compared to normal quantity for trade.

## Example: 

- You received a trade with quantity of 100 for default investment account of 100K. 
- If your individual account is only for 50K, then normal quantity for purchase is 50 (adjusted). 
- Now if you also want to adjust this quantity by a specific factor like 50% (as opposed to default 100%), then the purchase quantity after applying "quantity percent per trade" factor will be 25.
