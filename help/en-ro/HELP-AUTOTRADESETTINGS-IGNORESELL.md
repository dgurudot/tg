# **Ignore Sell Signal**


- You can choose to ignore sell signal and can sell it manually via limit, market or trail orders.
- Sell signal when ignore is enabled would not be executed where AutoTrade is enabled.
- **Note**: Ignore Sell Signal only works for standard sell signal (with retry mechanism and placing market order). It is not meant for limit sell orders.
