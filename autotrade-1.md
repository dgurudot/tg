## Agree that you must pay attention to auto trade and do NOT leave it unattended

You're are always supposed to pay attention and take control of your auto trades when appropriate
- Auto trade is similar to car driver-assist technology like cruise control and auto-pilot where the trader is always required to pay attention to the screen and be able to take control of your trades manually.
- If your trading application is not active or loses network connectivity then auto trades would STOP executing. If you have an active order with stop active with broker then it would get executed by your broker but you will not be able to execute any other auto trade signals while network is disconnected on device with autotrade enabled.
- AutoTrade is NOT managed service and should NOT be assumed and treated that way. Kindly set your appropriate risk management controls available via platform and use autotrade and global account settings to fine tune it based on your individual risk appetite.
