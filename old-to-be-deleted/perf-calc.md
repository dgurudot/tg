# **How we compute performance**
 - **Gain %** reflect the profit range for specific trade. It also shows the profit target acheived by green color.
 - Trade is "closed" when we don't recommend any additional buys for stock and we are in sell zone. You can continue to hold in sell zone for swing and long trades.
 - Minimum captured profit is from B1 (First Buy Price) to S1 (First Sell Target) price that we reached.
 - If you hold beyond the S1 in sell zone, then you get the max profit potential and it is shown in Gain % range where we hit S3 target.
 - Day trades do not have hold beyond a day so we typically don't track hitting S2, S3 targets although users can still choose to sell only a portion at S1 and then make more profits at S2, S3 and beyond on same day. For Day trades (with D tag), we only show the minimum profit for specific trade.
 - Swing trades are tagged with "S" (Amber color) tag. Long term trades are tagged with "L" (Green) color tag located next to symbol on right side.
