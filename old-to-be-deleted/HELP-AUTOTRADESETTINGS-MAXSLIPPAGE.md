# **Max Slippage**

## Purpose: 

- This setting allows you to specify the maximum percentage slippage from the signal to actual limit order price.

## Example:

- If your max slippage is 1%, and signal received is for $100 buy price then your retry would stop if the actual limit order price is above $101
