# How we compute past performance
 - Trade is "closed" when we don't recommend any additional buys for stock and we are in sell zone. You can continue to hold in sell zone.
 - Minimum captured profit is from B1 to S1 price that we reached.
 - If you hold beyond the S1 in sell zone, then you get the max profit potential and it is also reflected in profit %.
