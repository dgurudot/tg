# How we compute past performance
 - Trade is "closed" when we don't recommend any additional buys for stock and we are in sell zone. You can continue to hold in sell zone for swing and long trades.
 - Minimum captured profit is from B1 to S1 price that we reached.
 - If you hold beyond the S1 in sell zone, then you get the max profit potential and it is also reflected in profit %.
 - Day trades do not have hold beyond a day so we typically don't track hitting S2, S3 targets although users can still choose to sell only a portion at S1 and then make more profits at S2, S3 and beyond. For Day trades (with D tag), we only show the minimum profit for specific trade.
